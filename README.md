FastJPReader
============

This is a bookmarklet to help read Japanese text faster. The concept comes from Spritz.

This bookmarklet uses [TinySegmenter](http://chasen.org/~taku/software/TinySegmenter/) as a library for parsing Japanese text.

Some known problems:
- Currently, the bookmarklet can only be used on UTF-8 encoded text.
- Obviously, parsing of the Japanese is not the best. English is much easier to parse because of spaces between words.
